# Use in templates

Add a simple include to your `.ss` template which displays the `DMSDocument` right where you would like the
_Request a printed copy_ button to be displayed.

```
<% include CartActions %>
```

You can fine tune the HTML markup or display behaviour of any of the templates in `/dms/templates/Includes` to change
the way documents will be displayed in your project.
