### Translations

Translations of the natural language strings are managed through a
third party translation interface, transifex.com.
Newly added strings will be periodically uploaded there for translation,
and any new translations will be merged back to the project source code.

Please use [https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-dms/](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-dms/) to contribute translations,
rather than sending pull requests with YAML files.

See the ["i18n" topic](http://doc.silverstripe.org/framework/en/trunk/topics/i18n) on doc.silverstripe.org for more details.
